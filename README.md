# Zero-Judge-practice
I try to catch my data structure with C language again. Gook luck for me. Fingerprint of learning


This is the repo for self learining in zero judge. I might discuss smth about data structure and algorithm here.
Actually I wanna enroll graphic theory this semester (2024 Fall) but I find I am too busyyyyyyyy. (21 credits now)
As I have pass discrete mathematics with A+, I guess it's enought for algorithm ( I hope so )

I will leave what I learn step by step and the date. Now I start from C. I learn how to printf, scanf, pointer, reference.
And also concept of overflow. And how to dealt with overflow. (Sep, 2024)

If you are also a beginner, I hope my finger print will hlep you (I hope so but it is really smth basic)
